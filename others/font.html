<p>Water is the most important <span>resource.</span> It is very essential for the life of the flora and fauna on the planet. Without water, there would be no life and earth will be as dry as stone. Water is also necessary for irrigation and essential everyday works. Today, we waste water, without realizing its importance.</p>
<p>We take very minimal attempt to save water. Water is wasted in religious gatherings, functions, and celebrations, etc. In houses also, water is wasted every day. We have a habit of keeping the tap running while we brush, shave, bathe or do any other daily activity. All attempts must be made to save water.
